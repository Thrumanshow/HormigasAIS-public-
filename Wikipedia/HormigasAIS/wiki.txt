'''HormigasAIS''' is an open digital ecosystem founded by Salvadoran creator '''Cristhiam Quiñonez'''. It focuses on collaborative intelligence, artificial intelligence (AI), marketing automation, and open-source development.

== Overview ==
HormigasAIS started as a personal blog and evolved into a multidisciplinary lab combining SEO tools, community insights, and AI-powered experiments. The project's mission is to make automation accessible and ethical for individuals and teams in Latin America and beyond.

== Components ==
* **Open Lab** – GitHub repository with scraping tools, SEO analyzers, and automation flows using [n8n](https://n8n.io/).
* **Newsletter** – Biweekly publication called *HormigasAIS-Community* sharing insights on automation, job trends, and digital workflows.
* **Virtual Character** – An AI-driven character named '''XOXO''' symbolizes the blend of storytelling, development, and data science within the project.

== Philosophy ==
The project embraces the mantra: ''"La mente curiosa y la colaboración humana"'' (A curious mind and human collaboration), aiming to demystify AI through cultural and community lenses.
